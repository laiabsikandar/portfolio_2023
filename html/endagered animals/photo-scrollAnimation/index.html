                <h2>African Elephent</h2>
                <p>
                    African elephants are the largest animals walking the Earth. Their herds wander through 37 countries in Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that is used for communication and handling objects. And their large ears allow them to radiate excess heat. <br>
                    Upper incisor teeth develop into tusks in African elephants and grow throughout their lifetime. There are two species of African elephants—the savanna (or bush) elephant and the forest elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their tusks curve outwards. In addition to being smaller, forest elephants are darker and their tusks are straighter and point downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton between the two species.

                <h2>Ethiopian Wolf, Simien Jackal</h2>
                <p>
                    Ethiopian wolves are slender, long-limbed canids. Their coats are reddish, with white marks on their legs, tail, belly, face, and chin. The border between the white and red fur is quite distinct. On the face are white markings, which include, below the eyes, a characteristic white crescent, and on the cheeks a white spot. The chin and the throat are also white. Their tails are marked with an undefined black stripe along the length, tipped with bushy black hairs. The ears are wide but pointed, and the muzzle, gums, and palate are colored black. Females are usually paler in color and smaller overall. The feet have five toes at the front and four on the back feet.

                <h2>Panthera Tigris</h2>
                <p>
                    The range of tigers once extended across Asia from eastern Turkey and the Caspian Sea south of the Tibetan plateau eastward to Manchuria and the Sea of Okhotsk. 
                    Tigers were also found in northern Iran, Afghanistan, the Indus valley of Pakistan, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the islands of Java and Bali. Tigers are now extinct or nearly extinct in most of these areas. Populations remain relatively stable in northeastern China, Korea, Russia, and parts of India and the Himalayan region.

                <p>
                    Availability of water is a vital life condition for the Wild water buffalo. The area of their distribution includes south-eastern Nepal, southern Bhutan, western Thailand, eastern Cambodia, and south-western Vietnam. Buffaloes in Vietnam usually come from the Mondulkiri region of neighboring Cambodia. 
                    The Wild water buffalo are also widely distributed over northern, eastern, and central regions of Myanmar. Habitat of wild water buffaloes includes swamps, flooded grasslands, other wetlands, alluvial plains, and densely vegetated river valleys while forests serve them as shelter.

                <h2>Polar Bear</h2>
                <p>
                    Polar bear, also called white bear, sea bear, or ice bear, great white northern bear found throughout the Arctic region. 
                    The polar bear travels long distances over vast desolate expanses, generally on drifting oceanic ice floes, searching for seals, its primary prey. The polar bear is the largest and most powerful carnivore on land, a title it shares with a subspecies of brown bear called the Kodiak bear. 
                    It has no natural predators and knows no fear of humans, making it an extremely dangerous animal.<br>
                    Polar bears are stocky, with a long neck, relatively small head, short, rounded ears, and a short tail. Sunlight can pass through the thick fur, its heat being absorbed by the bear's black skin. Under the skin is a layer of insulating fat. The broad feet have hairy soles to protect and insulate as well as to facilitate movement across ice, as does the uneven skin on the soles of the feet, which helps to prevent slipping. 
                    Strong, sharp claws are also important for gaining traction, for digging through ice, and for killing prey.
